`dl-verify`
===========

A project to build a small binary file which will download and verify the signature of that file against a given key.

Ideal useage:

`dl-verify --signature-ext='.asc' --signing-key=595E85A6B1B4779EA4DAAEC70B588DFF0527A9B7 https://github.com/krallin/tini/releases/download/v0.15.0/tini ./tini`

And upon successful completion a single file will exist on disk `./tini` which contains the [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini) binary.

## Building

- Dependencies are managed with [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) because otherwise builds are üôÅ, install with `go get github.com/Masterminds/glide` because yolo
  - Could update go [go-dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) but I haven't used it yet
- Install packages with `glide install`, add packages with `glide get`, update versions with `glide update`
- Build with `go build ./...` (output will be named for the directory under `cmd/` and placed in the root)
- Test with `go test ./lib/...` to avoid testing the vendored libraries
